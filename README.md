# Matthew Davis — Enterprise AI Architect (Governance + Research)  
Designing reflexive, semantic, and adaptive systems for AI-native organizations.

---

## 👋 Welcome
I’m an Enterprise AI Architect focused on building **governed, reflexive, and semantically coherent architectures** that help organizations evolve toward AI-native operations.

My work spans **reasoning systems**, **semantic governance**, **cognitive architectures**, and **enterprise-scale transformation**.  
I treat architecture as a **living knowledge system**—structured, adaptive, and continuously self-correcting.

---

## 🧠 Architectural Focus Areas
- **Reflexive Governance Systems**  
  Ensuring alignment, semantic integrity, and continuous architectural health.

- **Cognitive & Multi-Surface Knowledge Architecture**  
  Structuring knowledge across thinking surfaces, operational surfaces, governance surfaces, and public surfaces.

- **Adaptive Reasoning Pipelines**  
  Designing decision systems capable of perception, context, inference, evaluation, adjustment, and reinforcement.

- **AI-Native Enterprise Design**  
  Integrating reasoning, governance, semantics, and strategy into unified enterprise architectures.

## 🧩 Architectural Philosophy  
**Knowledge is a system, not a repository.**  
**Governance is a function, not a document.**  
**Reflexivity is the foundation of AI-native resilience.**  
**Semantics are the backbone of intelligent enterprise design.**

I design architectures that think, learn, align, and evolve.
